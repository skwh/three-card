# Three Card
Three Card is a card game for 2-4(\*) people that uses a standard deck of 52
cards. 

Also known as:
- f\*ck your neighbor

(\*): The game may be played with any number of players greater than 2. For each
4 players, another deck of 52 cards must be added to play.

## Rules
The goal of the game is to have no cards in your hand or playable for you.

This is a "stacking game" where each player takes a turn to place a card on top
of a pile. The card must be of equal or higher value to the card below it, with
exceptions for **special cards**.

The order of turns is done counterclockwise, or from the left of the dealer.

### Card Values

The order of card values is as follows, from the lowest value to the highest
value.
1. 3
2. 4
3. 5
4. 6
5. 7
6. 8
7. 9
8. J
9. Q
10. K
11. A

**Special cards** are as follows. These cards may be played on top of any other
card.

- 2: After you play a 2, you may play again, and you may place any other card on
  top of this card.
- 10: After you a play a 10, the entire **pile** is removed from play. You may
  play again. Because the pile is empty, you may play any card on the empty
  pile.

Jokers are not used in this game.

### Game Setup

From the left of the dealer, each player should be dealt two stacks of cards.
The first stack of three cards should be dealt face down. This stack is called
the **undercards** and it should not be turned over until later in the game.
The second stack consists of six cards.

From their second pile, each player should choose three cards to form their **top
cards**. These three cards are placed face up on top of the undercards. These
cards will be playable later in the game.

The last three cards form the player's starting hand.

Once each player has chosen their top cards, the players must choose who begins
play. From the left of the dealer, the first player who has the lowest value
card places it on the table to form **the pile**.

For example, the lowest value card is 3. So, if the first player to the left of
the dealer has a 3 in their hand, then they play it first and the game begins.
If all players do not have a 3 in their hand, then, starting to the left of the
dealer, the players see who has a 4. And so on.

The remaining cards are placed face down next to the pile. This is **the deck**.

### Play

During a player's turn, they must place a card that is of equal or greater value
than the card on top of the pile. **Players may play multiple of the same card
during their turn.**

If a player does not have a card in their hand that is of equal or greater value
than the card on the top of the pile, they must take the cards in the pile into
their hand.

After a player has placed a card the players should check the pile to see if the
following has occurred:
- if there are four cards of the same value in a row on the top of the pile,
  then the pile is removed from play and the player may play again with any card.
- if a 2 has been played, then the player may play any card again on top of the
  2.
- if a 10 has been played, then the pile is removed from play and the player may
  play any card to start a new pile.

**After a player places a card or cards, they must draw from the deck until they
have at least three cards again.** If there are no more cards in the deck, then
the game proceeds to the next phase of play.

### Once the deck is empty

Once all of the cards have been drawn from the deck, then players must focus on
getting rid of all of the cards in their hand. Once a player has played all
cards in their hand, they may pick up the cards from their **top cards**, which
becomes their hand.

Once a player has played all of the cards in their **top cards**, then, for each
turn, they may randomly draw a card from their **under cards** and place it on the
pile without looking at it first. If the drawn card's value is not equal to or
greater than the card on the top of the pile, they must take the pile into their
hand.

When a player no longer has any cards in their **top cards** or their **bottom cards**
then they win the game.

## Notes

### Drawing from the deck multiple times in a turn

It is permissible for a player to draw from the deck multiple separate times
during their turn. For example:

Player X has three cards in their hand: J, K, 2. The top card on the pile is A.
This player may:

1. Play the 2.
2. Draw from the deck so that they have three cards in their hand.
3. Play another card from their hand.
4. Draw from the deck so that they have three cards in their hand.
5. End their turn.

Or:

1. Play the 2 and any other card in their hand on top of it.
2. Draw from the deck so that they have three cards in their hand.
3. End their turn.

### Playing all four of a kind

A player may play all four of a kind during their turn, given that the value of
the pile is greater than the value of the card on the top of the pile. Once all
four cards are played, the pile is removed from play and the player may play
any card to start the pile again. In this way, four of a kind acts similar to a
10.

### Goofy stuff

This page was written by some goofballs who have played this game way too much.
We have the following names for different things that happen in the game:

- **The pile is removed from play**. This is called "blowing up the pile" or
  "kerchoo."
- **Three sixes are played in a row.** All players must scream "The number of the
  beast!"
- **Three sevens are played in a row.** All players must scream "The LUCKY number of the
  beast!"
- **Three sixes are played in a row, followed by the fourth six.** This is
  called an "exorcism."
- **You are forced to pick up the pile multiple times because the player to your
  right keeps playing cards higher than what is in your hand**. This is called
  "being on the train."
- **You are dealt an inital hand that has all low value cards in it.** You must
  say "who the fuck dealt?"
